## Our Commitment to Player Safety

At Pasadena Ponies, **safety isn't just a priorityâ€”it's a promise**. We ensure that every coach undergoes rigorous training to teach proper football fundamentals, safeguarding our young athletes. As Coach Marcus frequently emphasizes:

> "If we don't teach the kids to tackle and block safely, we're not doing our job. Safety first, wins second."

It's this dedication that has earned the trust of parents throughout Pasadena and Altadena for generations.
