## Proudly Serving Pasadena and Altadena Since 1987

The Pasadena Ponies Youth Football and Cheer program was born in the heart of Northwest Pasadena in 1987, offering kids from our community—often underserved and facing numerous challenges—a safe, structured, and positive environment to grow, compete, and thrive. Over the decades, we've become a central part of local youth sports, mentoring countless young athletes who've gone on to excel both on and off the field.

## Our Journey: From Ponies to Giants and Back Again

In recent years, Pasadena native and NFL standout **Darnay Holmes** sponsored our team, ushering in a new era as the Pasadena Giants. Holmes passionately reminded us, *"We all have something in common, we all want to improve—no L's, only lessons,"* guiding our youth with the principles of resilience and growth.

However, our heart and soul remained tied to our original identity. In 2023, embracing our roots, we proudly reclaimed our historic name, **Pasadena Ponies**, reconnecting with a legacy deeply cherished by our community.

## Building Champions, Creating Leaders

We're proud to have established a rich tradition of championship football, including:
- Two celebrated SCEYFL-AAU Super Bowl titles
- National recognition when our 6U team secured a runner-up finish in the AAU Youth National Championships in 2021
- Countless league championships and playoff appearances

But for us, championships are just part of the story. Our mission goes beyond winning—we shape character, instill discipline, integrity, teamwork, and accountability.

## Notable Alumni

### Tyron Brackenridge - NFL Cornerback
Ponies alumni have soared to exceptional heights, like NFL cornerback Tyron Brackenridge, who credits his success to our program: *"Playing for the Ponies was foundational—it taught me respect, discipline, and how to strive for excellence."*

### Calen Bullock - NFL Safety
Our younger generation continues to inspire as well, like NFL safety Calen Bullock, known as "Superglue" in his Ponies days for his legendary catching skills. Calen often credits the Pasadena Ponies for providing support after the loss of his father, helping him stay focused: *"This program gave me mentors who believed in me and taught me that adversity could be overcome."*

## A Family and a Community Institution

Located at the heart of Northwest Pasadena and Altadena, we strive to be a beacon of hope and positivity. With affordable participation fees, dedicated volunteer coaches, and scholarships, we ensure every child has the chance to participate. Our program fosters community unity and family involvement, believing wholeheartedly that it takes a village to raise strong, resilient youth.

Coach Tasha, one of our cheer directors, proudly shares, *"When you join the Ponies, you join a family. We're not just teaching cheers and plays—we're teaching life lessons."*

## Moving Forward, Honoring Our Past

Today, as the Pasadena Ponies, we stand stronger than ever—proud of our past, committed to our future, and unwavering in our dedication to youth development. We're not just about playing football; we're about shaping leaders, scholars, and responsible young adults.

Join us as we continue our mission, celebrating the vibrant legacy of the Pasadena Ponies.
